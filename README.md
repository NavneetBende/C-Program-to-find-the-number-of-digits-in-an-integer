Finding the number of digits in an integer in C
Today, we will be learning how to find the number of digits in an integer in C . An integer is made up of a group of digits, i.e; it is a combination of digits from 0-9

Here we will use loops along with an arithmetic operator.This program takes an integer from the user and calculates the number of digits. For example: If the user enters 6589, the output of the program will be 4.

Method Discussed :
Method 1 : Using loop
Method 2 : Using formulae.
Letâ€™s discuss above two methods in brief,

Method 1 :
Take a variable count =  0, to store the count of digits in the given number.
Run a while loop till n>2
Inside the loop increment the value of count by 1
Set n=n/10
After complete iteration print the value of count.
Method 1 : Code in C
Run
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main(){
    int n = 20901;
    int count = 0;
    
    while(n>0){
        count++;
        n = n/10;
    }
    printf("No. of digits = %d", count);

}
Output
No. of digits = 5
Method 2 :
In this method we will simple use the mathematical formulae,

No. of digits : floor(log10(n))+1
Method 2 : Code in C
Run
#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

int main(){
    int n = 20901;
    int x = floor(log10(n))+1;
    
    printf("No. of digits = %d", x);

}
Output
No. of digits = 5
